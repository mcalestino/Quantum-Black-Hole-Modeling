Simulating Black Hole Time Dilation using Classical and Quantum Neural Networks


This project simulates gravitational time dilation near Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes using a hybrid approach combining classical neural networks and quantum neural networks (QNNs).

It integrates concepts from general relativity, machine learning, and quantum computing to model how mass, distance, and spin affect the passage of time near black holes.

Key Achievements
	•	Simulated Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole time dilation using realistic relativistic formulas.
	•	Trained a classical neural network to predict Kerr time dilation values.
	•	Trained a quantum neural network using PennyLane embedded into TensorFlow.
	•	Compared classical vs quantum model performance.
	•	Visualized gravitational effects through 2D and 3D plots.

 Technologies Used
	•	Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
	•	TensorFlow and Keras (Classical Neural Networks)
	•	PennyLane (Quantum Machine Learning Framework)
	•	Astrophysics Simulation (Schwarzschild and Kerr Metrics)
