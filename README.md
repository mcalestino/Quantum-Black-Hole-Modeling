# Quantum-Black-Hole-Modeling
Simulating Black Hole Time Dilation using Classical and Quantum Neural Networks


This project simulates gravitational time dilation near Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes using a hybrid approach combining classical neural networks and quantum neural networks (QNNs).

It integrates concepts from general relativity, machine learning, and quantum computing to model how mass, distance, and spin affect the passage of time near black holes.
